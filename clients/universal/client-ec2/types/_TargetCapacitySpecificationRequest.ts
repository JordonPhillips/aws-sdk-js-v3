If you set a maximum price per hour for the On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances in your request, EC2 Fleet will launch instances until it reaches the maximum amount you're willing to pay. When the maximum amount you're willing to pay is reached, the fleet stops launching instances even if it hasnâ€™t met the target capacity.
