   * <p>Specifies the secret that you want to retrieve the attached resource-based policy for. You can specify either the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or the friendly name of the secret.</p> <note> <p>If you specify an ARN, we generally recommend that you specify a complete ARN. You can specify a partial ARN too—for example, if you don’t include the final hyphen and six random characters that Secrets Manager adds at the end of the ARN when you created the secret. A partial ARN match can work as long as it uniquely matches only one secret. However, if your secret has a name that ends in a hyphen followed by six characters (before Secrets Manager adds the hyphen and six characters to the ARN) and you try to use that as a partial ARN, then those characters cause Secrets Manager to assume that you’re specifying a complete ARN. This confusion can cause unexpected results. To avoid this situation, we recommend that you don’t create secret names that end with a hyphen followed by six characters.</p> </note>
