/**
 * <p>A tag that you can add to a resource. A tag is a label that you assign to an AWS Athena resource (a workgroup). Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. Tags enable you to categorize workgroups in Athena, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Use a consistent set of tag keys to make it easier to search and filter workgroups in your account. The maximum tag key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8. The maximum tag value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8. You can use letters and numbers representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: + - = . _ : / @. Tag keys and values are case-sensitive. Tag keys must be unique per resource. </p>
