  /**
   * <p>Attaches a policy to a root, an organizational unit (OU), or an individual account. How the policy affects accounts depends on the type of policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Service control policy (SCP)</b> - An SCP specifies what permissions can be delegated to users in affected member accounts. The scope of influence for a policy depends on what you attach the policy to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you attach an SCP to a root, it affects all accounts in the organization</p> </li> <li> <p>If you attach an SCP to an OU, it affects all accounts in that OU and in any child OUs</p> </li> <li> <p>If you attach the policy directly to an account, it affects only that account</p> </li> </ul> <p>SCPs are JSON policies that specify the maximum permissions for an organization or organizational unit (OU). When you attach one SCP to a higher level root or OU, and you also attach a different SCP to a child OU or to an account, the child policy can further restrict only the permissions that pass through the parent filter and are available to the child. An SCP that is attached to a child can't grant a permission that the paren't hasn't already granted. For example, imagine that the parent SCP allows permissions A, B, C, D, and E. The child SCP allows C, D, E, F, and G. The result is that the accounts affected by the child SCP are allowed to use only C, D, and E. They can't use A or B because the child OU filtered them out. They also can't use F and G because the parent OU filtered them out. They can't be granted back by the child SCP; child SCPs can only filter the permissions they receive from the parent SCP.</p> <p>AWS Organizations attaches a default SCP named <code>"FullAWSAccess</code> to every root, OU, and account. This default SCP allows all services and actions, enabling any new child OU or account to inherit the permissions of the parent root or OU. If you detach the default policy, you must replace it with a policy that specifies the permissions that you want to allow in that OU or account.</p> <p>For more information about how AWS Organizations policies permissions work, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html">Using Service Control Policies</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide.</i> </p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation can be called only from the organization's master account.</p>
