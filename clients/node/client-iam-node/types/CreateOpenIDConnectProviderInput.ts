This lets you maintain multiple thumbprints if the identity provider is rotating certificates.</p> <p>The server certificate thumbprint is the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the X.509 certificate used by the domain where the OpenID Connect provider makes its keys available. It is always a 40-character string.</p> <p>You must provide at least one thumbprint when creating an IAM OIDC provider. For example, assume that the OIDC provider is <code>server.example.com</code> and the provider stores its keys at https://keys.server.example.com/openid-connect. In that case, the thumbprint string would be the hex-encoded SHA-1 hash value of the certificate used by https://keys.server.example.com.</p> <p>For more information about obtaining the OIDC provider's thumbprint, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/identity-providers-oidc-obtain-thumbprint.html">Obtaining the Thumbprint for an OpenID Connect Provider</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
