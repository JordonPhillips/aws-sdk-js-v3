/**
 * <p>Describes an API key.</p> <p>Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key versions:</p> <p> <b>da1</b>: This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Key expiration is managed by Amazon DynamoDB TTL. The keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018 and should not be used after that date.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ListApiKeys</code> returns the expiration time in milliseconds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time in milliseconds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateApiKey</code> is not available for this key version.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteApiKey</code> deletes the item from the table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we will delete these keys from the table after February 21, 2018.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>da2</b>: This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added support to extend key expiration.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ListApiKeys</code> returns the expiration time in seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>UpdateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time in seconds and accepts a user-provided expiration time in seconds. Key expiration can only be updated while the key has not expired.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteApiKey</code> deletes the item from the table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds.</p> </li> </ul>
