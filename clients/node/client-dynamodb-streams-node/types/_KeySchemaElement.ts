/**
 * <p>Represents <i>a single element</i> of a key schema. A key schema specifies the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or the key attributes of an index.</p> <p>A <code>KeySchemaElement</code> represents exactly one attribute of the primary key. For example, a simple primary key (partition key) would be represented by one <code>KeySchemaElement</code>. A composite primary key (partition key and sort key) would require one <code>KeySchemaElement</code> for the partition key, and another <code>KeySchemaElement</code> for the sort key.</p> <note> <p>The partition key of an item is also known as its <i>hash attribute</i>. The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.</p> <p>The sort key of an item is also known as its <i>range attribute</i>. The term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.</p> </note>
