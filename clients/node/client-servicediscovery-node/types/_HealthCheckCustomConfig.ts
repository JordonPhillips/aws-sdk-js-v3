/**
 * <p>A complex type that contains information about an optional custom health check. A custom health check, which requires that you use a third-party health checker to evaluate the health of your resources, is useful in the following circumstances:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can't use a health check that is defined by <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> because the resource isn't available over the internet. For example, you can use a custom health check when the instance is in an Amazon VPC. (To check the health of resources in a VPC, the health checker must also be in the VPC.)</p> </li> <li> <p>You want to use a third-party health checker regardless of where your resources are.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>If you specify a health check configuration, you can specify either <code>HealthCheckCustomConfig</code> or <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> but not both.</p> </important> <p>To change the status of a custom health check, submit an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request. Cloud Map doesn't monitor the status of the resource, it just keeps a record of the status specified in the most recent <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p> <p>Here's how custom health checks work:</p> <ol> <li> <p>You create a service and specify a value for <code>FailureThreshold</code>. </p> <p>The failure threshold indicates the number of 30-second intervals you want AWS Cloud Map to wait between the time that your application sends an <a>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</a> request and the time that AWS Cloud Map stops routing internet traffic to the corresponding resource.</p> </li> <li> <p>You register an instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>You configure a third-party health checker to monitor the resource that is associated with the new instance. </p> <note> <p>AWS Cloud Map doesn't check the health of the resource directly. </p> </note> </li> <li> <p>The third-party health-checker determines that the resource is unhealthy and notifies your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your application submits an <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>AWS Cloud Map waits for (<code>FailureThreshold</code> x 30) seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>If another <code>UpdateInstanceCustomHealthStatus</code> request doesn't arrive during that time to change the status back to healthy, AWS Cloud Map stops routing traffic to the resource.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note the following about configuring custom health checks.</p>

Cloud Map still waits <code>FailureThreshold x 30</code> seconds after the first request to make the change.</p>
